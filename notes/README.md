# Ideas

Using colony, or something similar, once a story has been written, use some sort of schelling game or prediction market to give it a story point value. Prioritize it, then Mint and award the contributor(s) who complete(s) tokens equal to the priority times the story point value.

## Standardize

* CI/CD
  * use standard make commands and automatically get CI/CD
  * use the herd commands
    * test
    * integrate
    * release
